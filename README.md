1. The most challenging part of this task was ensuring the website is mobile-friendly across different devices. Adjusting the HTML and CSS to fit various screen sizes was a bit challenging. I spent approximately 20 hours on the entire assignment.

2. To make my website mobile-friendly, I used CSS media queries to adjust the location based on screen width. For example, I used the following CSS code:

css
Copy code
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    nav {
        justify-content: center;
    }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
    nav {
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    }
}

3. In terms of design, I focused on user experience, aiming for a clean and professional interface that performs well on different devices. I'm particularly proud of the adaptive navigation bar, which remains at the top for easy access.

4. Given more time and resources, I would consider adding some features such as a contact form and subtle animations to enhance user interaction. These additional features, combined with responsive design, can improve the overall user experience. Overall, I spent around 20 hours completing this task, creating all the code parts from scratch.
